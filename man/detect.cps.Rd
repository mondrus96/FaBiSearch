\usage{
detect.cps(
  Y,
  mindist = 35,
  nruns = 50,
  nreps = 100,
  alpha = NULL,
  rank = NULL,
  algtype = "brunet",
  testtype = "t-test"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{An input multivariate time series in matrix format, with variables organized in columns and time points in rows. All entries in Y must be positive.}

\item{mindist}{A positive integer with default value equal to 35. It is used to define the minimum distance acceptable between detected change points.}

\item{nruns}{A positive integer with default value equal to 50. It is used to define the number of runs in the NMF function.}

\item{nreps}{A positive integer with default value equal to 100. It is used to define the number of permutations for the statistical inference procedure.}

\item{alpha}{A positive real number with default value set to NULL. When alpha = NULL, then the p-value calculated for inference on the change
points is returned. If alpha = a positive integer value, say 0.05, then it is used to define the significance level for inference on the change points.}

\item{rank}{A positive integer, which defines the rank used in the optimization procedure to detect the change points. If rank = NULL, which is also the
default value, then the optimal rank is computed. If rank = a positive integer value, say 4, then a predetermined rank is used.}

\item{algtype}{A character string, which defines the algorithm to be used in the NMF function. By default it is set to "brunet". See the "Algorithms" section of
\code{\link[NMF]{nmf}} for more information on the available algorithms.}

\item{testtype}{A character string, which defines the type of statistical test to use during the inference procedure. By default it is set to "t-test". The
other options are "ks" and "wilcox" which correspond to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon tests, respectively.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components :\cr
\code{rank}: The rank used in the optimization procedure for change point detection.\cr
\code{change_points}: A table of the detected change points where column "T" is the time of the change point and "stat_test" is the result (either a boolean value if alpha = a positive real number, or the p-value if alpha = "p-value") of the t-test.\cr
\code{compute_time}: The computational time, saved as a "difftime" object.\cr
}
\description{
This function detects multiple change points in the network (or clustering) structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series using
non-negative matrix factorization and a binary search.
