@article{Zhang2008,
abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely applicable and effective approach  in blind source separation (BSS), with limitations that sources are statistically independent. However, more common situation is blind source separation for nonnegative linear model (NNLM) where the observations are nonnegative linear combinations of nonnegative sources, and the sources may be statistically dependent. We propose a pattern expression nonnegative matrix factorization (PE-NMF) approach from the view point of using basis vectors most effectively to express patterns. Two regularization or penalty terms are introduced to be added to the original loss function of a standard nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for effective expression of patterns with basis vectors in the PE-NMF. Learning algorithm is presented, and the convergence of the algorithm is proved theoretically. Three illustrative examples on blind source separation including heterogeneity correction for gene microarray data indicate that the sources can be successfully recovered with the proposed PE-NMF when the two parameters can be suitably chosen from prior knowledge of the problem.},

@article{Wang2006,
abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), a machine learning algorithm, has been applied to the analysis of microarray data. A key feature of NMF is the ability to identify patterns that together explain the data as a linear combination of expression signatures. Microarray data generally includes individual estimates of uncertainty for each gene in each condition, however NMF does not exploit this information. Previous work has shown that such uncertainties can be extremely valuable for pattern recognition.},

@article{Pascual-Montano2006,
abstract = {We propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization model that aims at finding  localized, part-based, representations of nonnegative multivariate data items. Unlike the classical nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, this new model, denoted "nonsmooth nonnegative matrix factorization" (nsNMF), corresponds to the optimization of an unambiguous cost function designed to explicitly represent sparseness, in the form of nonsmoothness, which is controlled by a single parameter. In general, this method produces a set of basis and encoding vectors that are not only capable of representing the original data, but they also extract highly localized patterns, which generally lend themselves to improved interpretability. The properties of this new method are illustrated with several data sets. Comparisons to previously published methods show that the new nsNMF method has some advantages in keeping faithfulness to the data in the achieving a high degree of sparseness for both the estimated basis and the encoding vectors and in better interpretability of the factors.},

@article{Gaujoux2010,
abstract = {Background: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.Results: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.Conclusions: The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from CRAN. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gaujoux and Seoighe; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{10.1093/bioinformatics/btm134,
abstract = {Motivation: Many practical pattern recognition problems require non-negativity constraints. For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.Availability: The software is available as supplementary material.Contact:hskim@cc.gatech.edu, hpark@acc.gatech.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Brunet2004a,
abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), an algorithm  based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

@article{Badea2008,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a clustering algorithm capable of simultaneously  factorizing two distinct gene expression datasets with the aim of uncovering gene regulatory programs that are common to the two phenotypes. The siNMF algorithm simultaneously searches for two factorizations that share the same gene expression profiles. The two key ingredients of this algorithm are the nonnegativity constraint and the offset variables, which together ensure the sparseness of the factorizations. While cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, there is overwhelming recent evidence that the differences between cancer subtypes implicate entire pathways and biological processes involving large numbers of genes, rather than changes in single genes. We have applied our simultaneous factorization algorithm looking for gene expression profiles that are common between the more homogeneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the more heterogeneous colon adenocarcinoma. The fact that the PDAC signature is active in a large fraction of colon adeocarcinoma suggests that the oncogenic mechanisms involved may be similar to those in PDAC, at least in this subset of colon samples. There are many approaches to uncovering common mechanisms involved in different phenotypes, but most are based on comparing gene lists. The approach presented in this paper additionally takes gene expression data into account and can thus be more sensitive.},
