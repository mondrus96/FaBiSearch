Description: The FaBiSearch package implements the Factorized Binary Search (FaBiSearch) methodology for the estimation of the number and location of multiple change-points in the network (or clustering) structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series. The method is motivated by the detection of change points in functional connectivity networks for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. FaBiSearch uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimension reduction technique and a new binary search algorithm to identify multiple change points.  It also requires minimal assumptions. The  main routines of the package are detect.cps, for change point detection, est.net, for estimating a network from stationary multivariate time series, plot.net, for plotting the estimated functional connectivity networks, and opt.rank, for finding the optimal rank to use for a given dataset. The functions have been extensively tested on high-dimensional simulated data and fMRI data.
