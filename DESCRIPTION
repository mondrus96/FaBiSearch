Description: The FaBiSearch package implements the Factorized Binary Search (FaBiSearch) methodology for the estimation of the number and location of multiple change points in the network (or clustering) structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series. The method is motivated by the detection of change points in functional connectivity networks for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. FaBiSearch uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimension reduction technique, and a new binary search algorithm to identify multiple change points.  It also requires minimal assumptions. The  main routines of the package are detect.cps, for change point detection, est.net, for estimating a network between stationary multivariate time series, plot.net, for plotting the estimated functional connectivity networks, and opt.rank, for finding the optimal rank in NMF for a given dataset. The functions have been extensively tested on multivariate high-dimensional simulated data and fMRI data.
