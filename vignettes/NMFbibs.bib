abstract = {The estimation of time varying networks for functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets is of increasing importance and interest. We formulate the problem in a high dimensional time series framework and introduce a data-driven method, namely network change points detection, which detects change points in the network structure of a multivariate time series, with each component of the time series represented by a node in the network. Network change points detection is applied to various simulated data and a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data set. This new methodology also allows us to identify common functional states within and across subjects. Finally, network change points detection promises to offer a deep insight into the large-scale characterizations and dynamics of the brain.},

abstract = {Many systems of interacting elements can be conceptualized as networks, where network nodes represent the elements and network ties represent interactions between the elements. In systems where the underlying network evolves, it is useful to determine the points in time where the network structure changes significantly as these may correspond to functional change points. We propose a method for detecting change points in correlation networks that, unlike previous change point detection methods designed for time series data, requires minimal distributional assumptions. We investigate the difficulty of change point detection near the boundaries of the time series in correlation networks and study the power of our method and competing methods through simulation. We also show the generalizable nature of the method by applying it to stock price data as well as fMRI data.},

Clustering is performed via an iterative optimization procedure to mutually reinforce the relationships between the coefficients. The mutually reinforcing optimization exploits the duality of the data and features and enable a simultaneous clustering of both data and features. We have shown the convergence property of the clustering algorithm and discussed its connections with various existential approaches.

abstract = {Motivation: Cis-acting regulatory elements are frequently constrained by both sequence content and positioning relative to a functional site, such as a splice or polyadenylation site. We describe an approach to regulatory motif analysis based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Whereas existing pattern recognition algorithms commonly focus primarily on sequence content, our method simultaneously characterizes both positioning and sequence content of putative motifs. Results: Tests on artificially generated sequences show that NMF can faithfully reproduce both positioning and content of test motifs. We show how the variation of the residual sum of squares can be used to give a robust estimate of the number of motifs or patterns in a sequence set. Our analysis distinguishes multiple motifs with significant overlap in sequence content and/or positioning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the NMF approach through characterization of biologically interesting datasets. Specifically, an analysis of mRNA 3′-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation) sites from a broad range of higher eukaryotes reveals a conserved core pattern of three elements. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Story understanding involves many perceptual and cognitive subprocesses, from perceiving individual words, to parsing sentences, to understanding the relationships among the story characters. We present an integrated computational model of reading that incorporates these and additional subprocesses, simultaneously discovering their fMRI signatures. Our model predicts the fMRI activity associated with reading arbitrary text passages, well enough to distinguish which of two story segments is being read with 74{\%} accuracy. This approach is the first to simultaneously track diverse reading subprocesses during complex story processing and predict the detailed neural representation of diverse story features, ranging from visual word properties to the mention of different story characters and different actions they perform. We construct brain representation maps that replicate many results from a wide range of classical studies that focus each on one aspect of language processing and offer new insights on which type of information is processed by different areas involved in language processing. Additionally, this approach is promising for studying individual differences: it can be used to create single subject maps that may potentially be used to measure reading comprehension and diagnose reading disorders.},

abstract = {Background: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.Results: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.Conclusions: The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from CRAN. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gaujoux and Seoighe; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a relatively new approach to analyze gene expression data that models data by additive combinations of non-negative basis vectors (metagenes). The non-negativity constraint makes sense biologically as genes may either be expressed or not, but never show negative expression. We applied NMF to five different microarray data sets. We estimated the appropriate number metagens by comparing the residual error of NMF reconstruction of data to that of NMF reconstruction of permutated data, thus finding when a given solution contained more information than noise. This analysis also revealed that NMF could not factorize one of the data sets in a meaningful way. We used GO categories and pre defined gene sets to evaluate the biological significance of the obtained metagenes. By analyses of metagenes specific for the same GO-categories we could show that individual metagenes activated different aspects of the same biological processes. Several of the obtained metagenes correlated with tumor subtypes and tumors with characteristic chromosomal translocations, indicating that metagenes may correspond to specific disease entities. Hence, NMF extracts biological relevant structures of microarray expression data and may thus contribute to a deeper understanding of tumor behavior.},

Commonly used NMF algorithms mainly target on minimizing the l2 distance or the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which may not be suitable for nonlinear cases. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method by maximizing the correntropy between the original and the product of two low-rank matrices for document clustering. This method also allows us to learn new basis vectors of the semantic feature space from data. To our knowledge, there is no existing work which clusters high dimensional document data by maximizing the correntropy in NMF. Our experimental results show the supremacy of the proposed method over other variants of NMF algorithms on Reuters21578 and TDT2 databasets.},

abstract = {Most statistical analyses of fMRI data assume that the nature, timing and duration of the psychological processes being studied are known. However, often it is hard to specify this information a priori. In this work we introduce a data-driven technique for partitioning the experimental time course into distinct temporal intervals with different multivariate functional connectivity patterns between a set of regions of interest (ROIs). The technique, called Dynamic Connectivity Regression (DCR), detects temporal change points in functional connectivity and estimates a graph, or set of relationships between ROIs, for data in the temporal partition that falls between pairs of change points. Hence, DCR allows for estimation of both the time of change in connectivity and the connectivity graph for each partition, without requiring prior knowledge of the nature of the experimental design. Permutation and bootstrapping methods are used to perform inference on the change points. The method is applied to various simulated data sets as well as to an fMRI data set from a study (N= 26) of a state anxiety induction using a socially evaluative threat challenge. The results illustrate the method's ability to observe how the networks between different brain regions changed with subjects' emotional state. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), an algorithm based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been widely used to study basic and translational neuroscience questions. In real-time closed-loop neuroscience experiments, many practical issues arise, such as trial-by-trial variability, and spike sorting noise or multi-unit activity. In this paper, we propose a new framework for change-point detection based on ensembles of independent detectors in the context of BMI application for detecting acute pain signals. Motivated from ensemble learning, our proposed {\^{a}}{\{}$\backslash$texteuro{\}}{\oe}ensembles of change-point detectors{\^{a}}{\{}$\backslash$texteuro{\}} (ECPDs) integrate multiple decisions from independent detectors, which may be derived based on data recorded from different trials, data recorded from different brain regions, data of different modalities, or models derived from different learning methods. By integrating multiple sources of information, the ECPDs aim to improve detection accuracy (in terms of true positive and true negative rates) and achieve an optimal trade-off of sensitivity and specificity. We validate our method using computer simulations and experimental recordings from freely behaving rats. Our results have shown superior and robust performance of ECPDS in detecting the onset of acute pain signals based on neuronal population spike activity (or combined with local field potentials) recorded from single or multiple brain regions.},

abstract = {The approximation of arbitrary two-dimensional curves by polygons is an importanttechnique in image processing. For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small—but not minimum—number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive.},

Mathematically, NMF can be formulated as a minimization problem with non-negative constraints.

Currently, the most popular approach to solve NMF is the multiplicative update algorithm proposed by Lee and Seung.
