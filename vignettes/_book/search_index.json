FaBiSearch and the associated methods are unique in that they utilize non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for both change point detection and stationary network estimation. The FaBiSearch package depends on the following packages available on CRAN: NMF doParallel foreach utils parallel The remainder of this document is outlined as follows - we will first describe the computational workflow for change point detection and network estimation, then we describe the two main functions of this package, and finally we delve into subfunctions which are utilized by these main functions. 0.2 Methods 0.2.1 Non-negative matrix factorization Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a matrix factorization technique which constrains the input data matrix and associated factors to non-negative values (Lee and Seung 2001). NMF has the following setup: consider an \\(n \\times p\\) matrix, \\(\\boldsymbol X\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of independent samples and \\(p\\) is the number of features. NMF attempts to recreate the original matrix \\(X\\), as the dot product of a coefficient matrix, \\(W\\), and a basis matrix, \\(H\\) (Figure ?? ). The dimensionality of factors \\(W\\) and \\(H\\) is controlled by the hyperparameter rank, \\(r\\), where \\(r &lt;&lt; min(n,p)\\). Figure 1: Caption with spaces 0.3 Main Functions There are two main functions which are useful in a multivariate time series context. The first is FaBiSearch() which is used for change point estimation, and the second is estimate_network() which is used for estimating an adjacency matrix for network estimation from a stationary multivariate time series.
